							<h2>GPU Compute Library using Vulkan</h2>

								<h3>Project Origins</h3>
								<p>In my final year of my undergraduate degree, one of the modules was conducting a year long research project to do with a topic related to video games. There were two paths I wished to pursue, either something to do with graphics or something to do with physics. Graphics was an option as I enjoy learning and using graphics APIs, physics was an option as I wasn’t too good at it, and I wanted to improve. In the end I selected a compromise, I decided to create a physics engine using a graphics API’s compute shaders. I was inspired to attempt this project as it could lead to better performance in certain scenarios in video games. The physics engine was later scaled down to just focus on ropes to make it manageable for development.</p>
								<p>I conducted this project using C++ and DirectX 12. The result was a physics system that was a bit wonky. The worst par however was that the system was inefficient and not well built, some bugs and issues had put a big stop on development and were only solved later. For myself I expected better and so I had the desire rebuild the system in a more optimized and reusable way. Also wanting to improve my investigational skills I applied for a masters with the focus on taking what I built in my undergraduate project and improving on it.</p>
								<hr />

								<h3>Proposal</h3>
								<p>For this project I wanted to focus on a specific aspect of my undergraduate project to ensure that I had time to guarantee its quality and not stretch myself over multiple subject areas. My proposal focused on trying to build a library that could simplify accessing the GPUs compute potential. During my time working on my undergraduate degree I found it difficult to fully understand how to interact with DirectX along with struggles to tackle bugs that stemmed from simple mistakes and misunderstandings. Originally the Library would again be built on DirectX 12 but my supervisor suggested using Vulkan which I accepted.</p>
								<p>The first steps of the project first started with identifying what a GPU was and how it was different to other processing units such as a CPU. This was then built out into identifying each processing unit’s strengths and weaknesses and why it would be useful for such a library to exist. The next steps focused on identifying other similar libraries that existed such as OpenMP and tools such as CUDA. It was decided that this project would focus on a library that could be added the project and which would make accessing the GPU easy but would still need developer input to work.</p>
								<hr />


								<h3>Initial Implementation</h3>

								<p>After the core ideas for the project were decided upon next I would need to establish writing to memory and performing code execution. The first project that was tackled was memory management. This resulted in a set of memory management classes that could read and write to memory. It focused on creating pools of memory that could have multiple variables written and read in smaller chunks in one large pool of memory. Once memory management was sorted I moved onto execution management. This was built on collecting commands that a developer wished execute, this was achieved by creating two classes that managed a kernel (compute shader) and a general compute class that allowed for a developer to execute a kernel and to process any commands. The memory management classes were then built into the kernel class to manage the memory for that kernel.</p>
								<p>All of these elements together built the 1.0 version of the library. Overall while the library achieve the ability to execute code on the GPU and to allow for a developer to collect the results, it was far from perfect. With the aim to make it as simple as possible to use it heavily limited what roles it could be used for and reduced the flexibility of the library, for example kernels could not share memory between each other. So while this was a good start for development, a reworked approach would be needed to ensure that I produced a high quality library.</p>
								
								<hr />

								<h3>Further Development</h3>
								
								<p>The first steps after version 1.0 began with trying to create very specific math classes that on their own could leverage the GPU. However early in the development of these classes it became clear that a common backend would be required to perform the specific of GPU compute that they could all be built on. This became version 2.0. Version 2.0 was built from the ground up to reimplement version 1.0 but in a way that allowed the system to be much more flexible. One key example was how memory was managed, instead of being built into the kernel the memory would be attached to a ‘Memory Adapter’ which could be now bound to multiple kernels. This new reimplementation allow for easier use of the library and quicker execution in most scenarios. While the original idea for the specific math classes where never built, the infrastructure laid down became the core of version 2.0. </p>
								<p>With version 2.0 being completed there was not much time left in the year and so testing on the library began. This testing included a physics engine, ray tracer and particle system. Each test completed and while slower than the CPU in most cases, was an improvement from my undergraduate degree. With the tests built and the library working data collection and the report was completed and handed in. Overall I was happy with the improvements and I will be making an effort to further optimize and improve the library.</p>

								<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<p>The last year has been fun, joyful, if a little stressful year. Over the course of this project I have deepened my knowledge of GPGPU compute and have produced a GPU compute library I am proud of even if it is not perfect. I am very grateful to my supervisor for all the help he has given me and I can’t wait to take my experience into the next year and next chapter going forward. I even got to try using an API I have wanted to learn for some time.</p>
