								<h3>Building a framework</h3>
								<p>This is a second semester 3rd year project that was a continuation of <a href="DirectX12Graphics.html">this project</a>. The focus of this project was to develop methods for terrain generation and animations.</p>
								<p>A key take away from developing in the provided framework was that certain elements quickly became messy and unmaintainable. So the first two weeks of the semester were spent refactoring the entire framework and any added features into a class. The resulting framework that was created helped greatly as it reduced the amount of code having to be repeated to perform the same task twice in two different places, reducing errors from mistyping and making the code easier to read.</p>

								<h3>Terrain Generation</h3>
								<p>With the framework built, functionality to build different types of terrain were added. This brought up many questions in implementation, for example, how would the framework retain detail on the terrain without a huge cost to performance, how would terrain be generated if no data was provided. All these questions would have to be answered to produce a robust terrain system.</p>
								<p>One technique used to solve terrain challanges was to implement an level of detail system. This was done by lowering details on terrain the further it got away from the camera. This distance was calculated in the hull shader and details were added or taken away in the pixel shader based on distance. Another technique that was deployed was tesselation, allowing for extra detail to be added. This uses the same level of detail system to add extra polygons when needed and remove added polygons when needed.</p>
